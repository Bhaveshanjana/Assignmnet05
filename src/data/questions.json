    "question": "A ball is thrown vertically upward with a velocity of 20 m/s. What will be its velocity after 3 seconds? (Take g = 10 m/s²)",
    "options": [
      "10 m/s upward",
      "10 m/s downward", 
      "50 m/s upward",
      "50 m/s downward"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Using v = u - gt, where u = 20 m/s, g = 10 m/s², t = 3s. So v = 20 - (10×3) = -10 m/s. Negative sign indicates downward direction."

    "options": [
      "CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃",
      "CH₃-CH=CH₂",
      "CH₂=CH₂",
      "CH₃-CH₂-CH₃"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Geometrical isomerism occurs when there are different groups on each carbon of the double bond. CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃ has different groups (CH₃ and H) on each carbon."

      "x² + 2x + 1",
      "3x² + 6x + 2"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Using power rule: f'(x) = d/dx(x³) + d/dx(3x²) + d/dx(3x) + d/dx(1) = 3x² + 6x + 3 + 0 = 3x² + 6x + 3"

      "25",
      "37",
      "49"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Using the formula α² + β² = (α + β)² - 2αβ. Here α + β = 5 and αβ = 6. So α² + β² = 5² - 2(6) = 25 - 12 = 13."
